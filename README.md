## Object Recognition with OpenCV and JavaFX


A project, made in Eclipse (Neon), for identify and track one or more tennis balls. It performs the detection of the tennis balls upon a webcam video stream by using the color range of the balls, erosion and dilation, and the `findContours` method. Some screenshots of the running project are available in the `screenshots` folder.

Please, note that the project is an Eclipse project, made for teaching purposes. Before using it, you need to install the OpenCV library (version 3.x) and JavaFX 8 and create a `User Library` named `opencv` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.
